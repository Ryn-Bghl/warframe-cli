# üéØ WARFRAME ULTIMATE "NEVER CHANGE" LOADOUT

## The One Loadout to Rule Them All

*If you could only pick ONE setup for literally everything in Warframe, this is it.*

---

## üë§ WARFRAME: **REVENANT PRIME**

### Why This Is THE Choice

Revenant was the highest-played Warframe overall in 2024, and for undeniable reasons:

**Mesmer Skin = Immortality Button**

- Enemy damage at level cap? **Mesmer Skin.**
- Annoying Eximus status effects? **Mesmer Skin.**
- Boss one-shot mechanics? **Mesmer Skin.**
- Knocked into a pit? **Mesmer Skin prevents that.**
- Toxin bypass shields? **Mesmer Skin blocks it.**

**Why It Never Gets Old:**

- ‚úÖ Works in EVERY mission type (Spy, Survival, Defense, Disruption, Eidolons, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Requires minimal build investment to be god-tier
- ‚úÖ Solo or team play - equally effective
- ‚úÖ Steel Path? Laughably easy
- ‚úÖ Level cap viable without breaking a sweat
- ‚úÖ Beginner-friendly but scales infinitely
- ‚úÖ Never needs Helminth (but Roar/Nourish makes him even better)
- ‚úÖÎä•Î†• 4 (Danse Macabre) scales with enemy levels - literally cannot fall off

**The Reality:**
You press 2. You become immune. You win. It's that simple. No other Warframe offers this level of universal dominance with zero downsides.

**Build Focus:**

- High Duration (keep Mesmer Skin up longer)
- Decent Strength (more charges)
- Adaptation mod for the 1% of times you forget to press 2
- That's literally it. You're invincible.

---

## üéØ PRIMARY: **TORID INCARNON**

### Why This Over Everything Else

**The Room-Clearer Supreme**

- Point in general direction of enemies
- Hold fire button
- Everything dies
- Don't even need to aim precisely
- Has AoE of up to a couple meters
- Chains to other enemies automatically
- Beam weapon = easy to use

**Universal Application:**

- ‚úÖ Hallway tile sets? Cleared.
- ‚úÖ Open world? No problem.
- ‚úÖ Defense waves? Gone in seconds.
- ‚úÖ Steel Path crowds? Deleted.
- ‚úÖ Boss adds? What adds?
- ‚úÖ Nullifiers? Beam melts bubbles fast.

**Why Not Latron/Nataruk?**

- Nataruk = single-target focused (great, but less versatile)
- Latron = requires more aim (excellent, but not "lazy mode")
- Torid = "I want everything dead with minimum effort"

**The Reality:**
This is the weapon equivalent of Revenant's Mesmer Skin. It just WORKS. Everywhere. Always. Against everything. No thinking required.

**Build Focus:**

- Viral + Heat
- Multishot
- Critical Chance/Damage
- Let the beam do the rest

---

## üî´ SECONDARY: **KUVA NUKOR**

### Why This Is Perfect

**The Status Application God**

- Chains to 4+ enemies automatically
- Applies status to everything it touches
- Primes enemies for Condition Overload weapons
- Works at any range
- Microwave beam = satisfying
- Melts Nullifier bubbles instantly
- Can be built multiple ways (Heat, Radiation, Magnetic, Toxin)

**Versatility King:**

- ‚úÖ Crowd control through status
- ‚úÖ Single-target damage
- ‚úÖ Chain damage to groups
- ‚úÖ Strips armor (Heat procs)
- ‚úÖ Handles Corpus shields (Magnetic + Toxin)
- ‚úÖ Grineer armor (Viral + Heat)
- ‚úÖ Corrupted mixed factions (Radiation or Viral)

**Why Not Dual Toxocyst/Laetum?**

- Dual Toxocyst = amazing but requires headshot activation
- Laetum = kills steal mode, can be inconsistent
- Nukor = always on, always chaining, zero conditions

**The Reality:**
If Torid is overkill, Nukor handles it. If you need status priming, Nukor handles it. If you need Nullifier bubble deletion, Nukor handles it. It's the perfect secondary that complements everything.

**Build Focus:**

- Heat + Viral (most universal)
- OR Heat + Magnetic (Corpus specialist)
- Status Chance maxed
- Multishot for more chains
- Let it microwave everything

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è MELEE: **KRONEN PRIME**

### Why This Beats Everything Else

**The Complete Package**

- Highest Slash weighting in the game (70% Slash!)
- Excellent critical chance (30% base)
- Excellent status chance (30% base)
- Fast attack speed (1.08)
- Good range (2.4m)
- Condition Overload synergy is INSANE
- Spin-to-win capable
- Hybrid crit/status builds

**Why Kronen Over Other Melees:**

- Glaive Prime = great but requires throwing playstyle
- Nikana Prime = excellent but slightly less status
- Hate Incarnon = heavy attack focused only
- Magistar Incarnon = locks you into slams
- Kronen = does EVERYTHING well with no restrictions

**Universal Domination:**

- ‚úÖ Light attacks? Destroys.
- ‚úÖ Heavy attacks? Obliterates.
- ‚úÖ Spin attacks? Annihilates.
- ‚úÖ Steel Path? Trivializes.
- ‚úÖ Level cap? Scales infinitely with Condition Overload.
- ‚úÖ All enemy types? Slash bypasses shields and armor.

**Condition Overload Synergy:**
Your Kuva Nukor applies multiple status ‚Üí You slash with Kronen ‚Üí Everything explodes into Slash procs ‚Üí Bleed damage ignores armor ‚Üí Win.

**The Reality:**
This is THE melee weapon. It does everything, requires no specific playstyle, works with any mod configuration, and scales infinitely. You can literally use this from Earth to level 9999 Steel Path.

**Build Focus:**

- Condition Overload (mandatory)
- Blood Rush (combo scaling)
- Weeping Wounds (status scaling)
- Viral + Heat (combo with Nukor priming)
- Organ Shatter (crit damage)
- Berserker Fury (attack speed)

---

## üêæ COMPANION: **SMEETA KAVAT**

### Why Smeeta Is Non-Negotiable

**The Loot Multiplier**

- Charm buff doubles resources/Affinity for 2 minutes
- Stacks with Resource Boosters
- Can stack with itself (2x ‚Üí 4x ‚Üí 8x multipliers!)
- Works on EVERYTHING:
  - Resources
  - Mods
  - Affinity
  - Credits
  - Relics
  - Kuva
  - Endo
  - Literally everything

**Why Not Combat Companions?**

- Nautilus = great CC, but doesn't help farming
- Adarza = great for Eidolons, but that's niche
- Panzer Vulpaphyla = immortal but no loot boost
- Smeeta = you farm EVERYTHING faster, forever

**The Math:**
With Smeeta + Resource Booster + lucky Charm stacks:

- 1x base ‚Üí 2x (booster) ‚Üí 4x (Charm) ‚Üí 8x (double Charm)
- That's **8x resources** on lucky missions
- Even average is 4x with booster + single Charm

**The Reality:**
Warframe is a farming game. Smeeta makes you farm 2-8x faster. That means you reach your goals 2-8x faster. Over thousands of hours, this saves you LITERAL WEEKS of playtime. There is no companion that provides more value across your entire Warframe career.

**Build Focus:**

- Survival mods (Link Health, Link Armor, Link Shields)
- Tek Enhance (extends Charm duration to ~4 minutes!)
- Fetch (vacuum for loot)
- Charm precept (obviously)

---

## üéì FOCUS SCHOOL: **ZENURIK**

### Why Zenurik Over Everything

**Energy = Everything**

- Energy Pulse passive regenerates energy
- Wellspring gives energy per second
- Makes energy orbs more effective
- Allows infinite ability spam

**Why This Matters:**
Your Revenant needs energy to press 2 (Mesmer Skin). Without energy, you die. With Zenurik, you NEVER run out of energy. Ever.

**Universal Application:**

- ‚úÖ Benefits literally every Warframe
- ‚úÖ Allows ability-heavy playstyles
- ‚úÖ No need for Energize Arcane (save platinum!)
- ‚úÖ Works from minute 1 to hour 1000

**Why Not Other Schools?**

- Madurai = only for Eidolons (niche)
- Naramon = only for melee combo (redundant with Blood Rush)
- Vazarin = healing (unnecessary with Revenant immortality)
- Unairu = armor strip (weapons already do this)

**The Reality:**
Energy management is THE bottleneck in Warframe. Zenurik removes this bottleneck. This makes every mission smoother, every frame more enjoyable, and every build more effective.

---

## ‚ö° AMP: **777 (Klamora-Propa-Certus)**

### Why 777 Is The One

**Boss Shredder Supreme**

- Propa Scaffold = massive burst damage
- Klamora Prism = sustained beam for Vomvalysts
- Certus Brace = +20% crit chance (mandatory)

**Eidolon Hunting:**
This amp makes Eidolons trivial. That means:

- Faster Arcane farming
- Faster Focus farming  
- Faster Brilliant Shards
- More Platinum from selling

**Why Not Other Amps?**

- 177 = good, but Klamora is better than Raplak for versatility
- 747 = Phahd is niche, Propa is more universally strong
- 427 = lower damage ceiling

**The Reality:**
You build this amp once, and you're done with Operator gameplay forever. It handles Eidolons, Angels of Zariman, and any other Operator-required content with ease.

---

## üéØ NECRAMECH: **VOIDRIG**

### Why Voidrig + Kuva Grattler

**The Stationary Nuke**

- Arquebex cannon deletes everything
- Railjack content becomes trivial
- Orphix Venom solved
- Archon Hunts easier
- Open world boss fights trivialized

**Kuva Grattler:**
Works everywhere (Archwing, Ground, Necramech). This is THE archgun. Period.

---

## üö¢ RAILJACK: **Zetki Photor Mk III Turrets**

**Why Photor:**
Bypasses Corpus shields completely. Corpus Railjack missions are THE credit farms. Photor makes them instant.

---

**This is what 99% of veteran players would keep.**

Because at the end of the day, Warframe is about:

1. **Not dying** (Revenant)
2. **Killing everything** (Torid/Nukor/Kronen)  
3. **Getting more loot** (Smeeta)
4. **Having fun** (All of the above)

This loadout does all four. Forever. In every situation.
